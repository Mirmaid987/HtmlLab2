    <h1><strong>Columbia...</strong> <em>Would you wanna live here?</em></h1>

      <p>Honestly, growing up just outside of Columbia was not that bad. <br>
        I'd like to say, I had a better education that the kids who live in Columbia.
        The city itself is not that bad, I just do not like the people who live there.</p>

          <h2>Reasons I like Columbia</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Near the River</li>
        <li>Around a lot of little shops</li>
        <li>near the main highway</li>

<h2>It is quite a lovely small town.<br> There are a lot of antique shops to browse around
    some small local coffee shops.</h2>
